    "        - Avoid Reserved Keywords: Do not use Python's reserved keywords, such as print or list, as variable or function names.\n",
    "        - Be Specific and Clear: Choose names that accurately describe the purpose or content of the element they represent. Avoid generic or ambiguous names that may lead to confusion.\n",
    "        - Consistency within a Project: Ensure that all team members adhere to the same naming conventions within a project. Consistency is key for readability and collaboration.\n",
    "        - Use Comments When Necessary: Although meaningful names are preferred, there might be instances where additional context is required. In such cases, use comments to explain the purpose or functionality of the code.\n",
    "        - Refactoring: If you realize that a name is no longer suitable or does not align with naming conventions, consider refactoring your code. Refactoring improves code quality and readability."
